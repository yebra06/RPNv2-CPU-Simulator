..  include::   /references.inc

In this documentation page, I will discuss the steps, and tools I used to build an
RPN calculator using Python.

..  note::

    This is my first project documentation using Sphinx_ . I was encouraged by my computer 
    architecure college Professor Roie_Black_ who has tought me many important concepts on 
    computer programming.

Source Code Control
===================

For this project I will use Git_ and Github_ to manage my source and documentation files.
I begin by setting up an empty repository with the name of my project. I then connect the 
server repository and the local development project directory.

Add a README
============

I then created a `README` file for this project. I have been recently introduced to the 
reStructuredText_ language and it is what I used to create the `README.rst` file.
``README.rst``. Here is a peek at the file:
